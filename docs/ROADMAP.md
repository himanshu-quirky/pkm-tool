# Roadmap

We want to be transparent about Notegrain’s development plan. The roadmap below is our best guess. It may change as we gather feedback.

## v0.1 – Basic functionality

- Add object types and a minimal rich editor for notes.
- Basic linking and backlink panel.
- Tagging and simple properties.
- Daily notes / journal.
- Data export and import via JSON.

## v0.2 – Better organization

- Add Graph view to explore relations.
- Add sets/collections and custom views (table/gallery).
- Support templates and quick capture.
- Attachments and media library (images, PDFs).

## v0.3 – Collaboration & capture

- Build a simple web clipper (manual paste first).
- Introduce "Spaces" (workspaces) for different vaults.
- Enable read-only sharing of objects or collections.

## v1.0 – Polish and extras

- Finalize PWA for mobile: offline-friendly interactions.
- Multi-vault support with migrations.
- Optional sync plugin for personal cloud or file-based sync.
- Extensive theming and plugin API.
